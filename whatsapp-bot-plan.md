## 5. Why Vector DB + Self-Hosted Approach?

### 5.1 Key Advantages

**💰 Massive Cost Savings**
- **No API fees**: No per-message charges from WhatsApp providers
- **No AI API costs**: No OpenAI/GPT charges (can run 1000s of queries for free)
- **Predictable costs**: Fixed VPS cost, no surprises
- **Year 1 savings**: €16,300 compared to traditional approach
- **Ongoing savings**: €13,800+ per year

**🔒 Privacy & Data Control**
- **Data stays local**: No sending customer messages to third parties
- **GDPR compliant**: Full control over data storage and processing
- **No vendor lock-in**: Own your infrastructure and data
- **Business API audit**: No need for WhatsApp Business API verification process

**⚡ Performance & Reliability**
- **Faster responses**: Local embeddings = no API latency
- **No rate limits**: Process unlimited messages
- **Offline capability**: Works even if external APIs are down
- **Scalable**: Add more VPS resources as needed

**🎯 Customization & Control**
- **Full control**: Modify any part of the system
- **Custom knowledge**: Fine-tune what the bot knows
- **Easy updates**: Update knowledge base without retraining
- **No API limitations**: Not constrained by provider features

**🌍 Multilingual Support (EN + ES)**
- **Built-in**: Multilingual embedding models support 50+ languages
- **Natural switching**: Detect and respond in user's language
- **Same infrastructure**: No extra cost for multiple languages

### 5.2 Trade-offs to Consider

**Initial Complexity**
- ⚠️ More setup required than plug-and-play APIs
- ✅ But: One-time effort, long-term benefits

**Server Management**
- ⚠️ Need to maintain VPS server
- ✅ But: Simple Docker setup, minimal maintenance

**WhatsApp Web Limitations**
- ⚠️ Requires phone to be online (can use virtual phone)
- ✅ But: Community has solutions, very reliable

**Response Quality**
- ⚠️ Not as flexible as GPT-4 for complex queries
- ✅ But: Can add local LLM later if needed, templates work great for FAQs

### 5.3 Best of Both Worlds

This approach gives you:
- 🎯 **Structured responses** for common questions (templates)
- 🔍 **Semantic search** for finding relevant information (vector DB)
- 🤖 **Optional AI generation** for complex queries (local LLM if needed)
- 💸 **Near-zero operating costs** (no per-message fees)

---

## 6. Technical Architecture

### 6.1 Platform & Infrastructure

**Self-Hosted WhatsApp Integration**
- **Approach**: WhatsApp Web API / WWebJS (no external providers needed)
- **Reasoning**: No API fees, full control, privacy-friendly
- **Features**: Rich media, interactive messages, no rate limits from providers

**Backend Architecture (Vector DB + RAG)**
```

- **SMS**: Urgent lead alerts (optional)

### 6.3 Vector Database + RAG Approach

**Knowledge Base Setup**

1. **Document Collection** (What goes into Vector DB):
   - All website content (services, pricing, FAQs)
   - Service descriptions (WhatsApp automation, event displays)
   - Case studies and examples
   - Common questions and answers
   - Company information and approach
   - Integration capabilities
   - Technical specifications

2. **Embedding Generation** (No API keys needed):
   ```python
   # Using local embedding model (sentence-transformers)
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
   
   model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # Fast, lightweight
   # OR: 'paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2' for ES/EN support
   
   # Generate embeddings for all knowledge base documents
   embeddings = model.encode(documents)
   ```

3. **Vector Database Storage**:
   ```python
   # ChromaDB (runs locally, no API needed)
   import chromadb
   
   client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./vector_db")
   collection = client.create_collection("company_knowledge")
   
   # Store documents with embeddings
   collection.add(
       documents=documents,
       embeddings=embeddings,
       metadatas=[{"source": "website", "type": "faq"}],
       ids=[f"doc_{i}" for i in range(len(documents))]
   )
   ```

**Query Processing Flow**

1. **User sends message** → "How much does WhatsApp automation cost?"

2. **Embed user query** (using same local model):
   ```python
   query_embedding = model.encode([user_message])[0]
   ```

3. **Retrieve relevant documents** from Vector DB:
   ```python
   results = collection.query(
       query_embeddings=[query_embedding],
       n_results=3  # Top 3 most relevant documents
   )
   ```

4. **Generate response** (Two options):

   **Option A: Template-based (No LLM needed)**
   - Match to pre-written templates using similarity scores
   - Fast, predictable, no hallucinations
   - Best for FAQ-style questions
   
   **Option B: Local LLM (Optional, still no API)**
   ```python
   # Using Ollama with Llama 3 or Mistral (runs locally)
   import ollama
   
   context = "\n".join(results['documents'])
   prompt = f"""
   Based on this information:
   {context}
   
   Answer the user's question: {user_message}
   Keep it concise and friendly.
   """
   
   response = ollama.generate(model='llama3', prompt=prompt)
   ```

**Intent Recognition (Keyword + Semantic Search)**
```python
# Hybrid approach: Keywords + Vector similarity
intents = {
    "pricing": ["precio", "price", "cost", "cuanto", "how much"],
    "timeline": ["cuando", "when", "plazo", "timeline", "cuanto tarda"],
    "consultation": ["consulta", "reunion", "meeting", "schedule"],
    "event_display": ["display", "evento", "event", "booth", "stand"],
    "whatsapp": ["whatsapp", "chatbot", "automation", "bot"],
    "integration": ["integrar", "integrate", "crm", "system"],
    "human": ["hablar", "persona", "human", "help"]
}

def detect_intent(message):
    # First: Check keywords
    for intent, keywords in intents.items():
        if any(kw in message.lower() for kw in keywords):
            return intent
    
    # Second: Vector similarity to intent examples
    results = intent_collection.query(
        query_embeddings=[embed(message)],
        n_results=1
    )
    
    if results['distances'][0][0] < 0.5:  # High similarity
        return results['metadatas'][0]['intent']
    
    return "unknown"
```

**Entity Extraction (Regex + Patterns)**
```python
import re

entities = {}

# Extract company name (capitalized words)
if match := re.search(r'\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+)*\b', message):
    entities['company_name'] = match.group()

# Extract numbers (inquiry volume, budget)
if match := re.search(r'(\d+)\s*(messages?|mensajes?|inquiries)', message):
    entities['inquiry_volume'] = match.group(1)

# Extract dates
if match := re.search(r'\b(\d{1,2})[/-](\d{1,2})[/-](\d{4})\b', message):
    entities['event_date'] = match.group()

# Extract urgency from phrases
urgency_map = {
    "urgente": "high",
    "pronto": "high", 
    "exploring": "low",
    "next month": "medium"
}

for phrase, level in urgency_map.items():
    if phrase in message.lower():
        entities['urgency'] = level
```

**Fallback Strategy**
1. Try keyword matching first (fastest)
2. Query vector DB for similar questions
3. If confidence > 70%, use retrieved answer
4. If confidence < 70%, offer menu options
5. Always provide "talk to human" option

### 6.4 Security & Compliance

**Data Protection**
- **GDPR Compliant**: Data storage in EU
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Database**: Encrypted at rest
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions
- **Data Retention**: Configurable (default 2 years)
- **Right to Delete**: Automated user data deletion

**Authentication**
- **Webhook Verification**: Validate WhatsApp signatures
- **API Keys**: Secure environment variables
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse

**Privacy**
- **Privacy Policy**: Clear opt-in/opt-out
- **Data Usage**: Transparent about what's collected

### 8.2 Content Chunking Strategy

**Document Chunking Best Practices:**

```python
# Break content into semantic chunks (not too big, not too small)

chunks = [
    {
        "text": "WhatsApp automation costs €5,500 for initial setup plus €1,200 per month for support.",
        "metadata": {
            "type": "pricing",
            "service": "whatsapp",
            "language": "en"
        }
    },
    {
        "text": "La automatización de WhatsApp cuesta €5.500 para configuración inicial más €1.200 al mes por soporte.",
        "metadata": {
            "type": "pricing",
            "service": "whatsapp",
            "language": "es"
        }
    },
    {
        "text": "Most clients see ROI within 3 months. If you handle 50+ WhatsApp inquiries daily, that's ~20 hours/week of staff time.",
        "metadata": {
            "type": "roi",
            "service": "whatsapp",
            "language": "en"
        }
    },
    # ... more chunks
]
```

**Optimal Chunk Size:**
- **Size**: 100-300 words per chunk
- **Overlap**: 20-50 words between chunks (for context)
- **Reasoning**: Balance between context and precision

### 8.3 Embedding Generation Script

```python
# prepare_knowledge_base.py

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import chromadb
import json

# 1. Load embedding model (multilingual for EN+ES support)
model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2')

# 2. Initialize ChromaDB
client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./vector_db")
collection = client.create_collection(
    name="company_knowledge",
    metadata={"description": "Dual Perspective Digital knowledge base"}
)

# 3. Load and chunk content
def load_content():
    """Load content from website files"""
    chunks = []
    
    # From copy.ts
    with open('lib/copy.ts', 'r') as f:
        # Extract service descriptions, pricing, etc.
        pass
    
    # From faq.ts
    with open('lib/faq.ts', 'r') as f:
        # Extract FAQ items
        pass
    
    return chunks

# 4. Generate embeddings
content_chunks = load_content()
texts = [chunk['text'] for chunk in content_chunks]
embeddings = model.encode(texts, show_progress_bar=True)

# 5. Store in vector DB
collection.add(
    documents=texts,
    embeddings=embeddings.tolist(),
    metadatas=[chunk['metadata'] for chunk in content_chunks],
    ids=[f"doc_{i}" for i in range(len(texts))]
)

print(f"✅ Stored {len(texts)} chunks in vector database")

# 6. Test retrieval
test_query = "How much does WhatsApp automation cost?"
query_embedding = model.encode([test_query])[0]

results = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[query_embedding.tolist()],
    n_results=3
)

print(f"\n🔍 Test query: {test_query}")
print(f"📄 Top result: {results['documents'][0][0]}")
print(f"🎯 Similarity: {1 - results['distances'][0][0]:.2f}")
```

### 8.4 Automated Content Updates

**Keep Vector DB Fresh:**

```python
# update_knowledge_base.py

def update_vector_db():
    """
    Run this script whenever website content changes
    to keep vector DB in sync
    """
    
    # 1. Detect changed files
    changed_files = check_git_diff(['lib/copy.ts', 'lib/faq.ts'])
    
    if not changed_files:
        print("✅ No changes detected")
        return
    
    # 2. Re-chunk and re-embed changed content
    new_chunks = process_changed_files(changed_files)
    
    # 3. Delete old embeddings for changed content
    collection.delete(where={"source": {"$in": changed_files}})
    
    # 4. Add new embeddings
    embeddings = model.encode([c['text'] for c in new_chunks])
    collection.add(
        documents=[c['text'] for c in new_chunks],
        embeddings=embeddings.tolist(),
        metadatas=[c['metadata'] for c in new_chunks],
        ids=[c['id'] for c in new_chunks]
    )
    
    print(f"✅ Updated {len(new_chunks)} chunks")

# Run as part of CI/CD pipeline or manually
if __name__ == "__main__":
    update_vector_db()
```

### 8.5 Quality Assurance

**Test Coverage for Vector Retrieval:**

```python
# test_vector_retrieval.py

test_cases = [
    # English queries
    ("How much does WhatsApp automation cost?", "pricing", "whatsapp"),
    ("What events do you work on?", "events", "barcelona"),
    ("Can you integrate with HubSpot?", "integration", "crm"),
    ("How long does setup take?", "timeline", "whatsapp"),
    
    # Spanish queries
    ("¿Cuánto cuesta la automatización de WhatsApp?", "pricing", "whatsapp"),
    ("¿Qué eventos hacéis?", "events", "barcelona"),
    ("¿Podéis integrar con nuestro CRM?", "integration", "crm"),
    
    # Conversational queries
    ("We get 100 messages a day, can you help?", "use_case", "whatsapp"),
    ("Need a display for MWC in March", "events", "urgent"),
]

def test_retrieval():
    for query, expected_type, expected_tag in test_cases:
        results = retrieve_from_vectordb(query, n=1)
        
        assert results['metadatas'][0]['type'] == expected_type, \
            f"Failed for: {query}"
        
        print(f"✅ {query[:50]}...")

test_retrieval()
print("\n🎉 All tests passed!")
```
